Machine Learning Application to Study Political Attitudes

In this repository I share replication materials for the article "Identifying Political Attitudes from Web Browsing Behavior:
Machine Learning Approach" which is available in a working paper form on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vfpdgvfbmzkc).

The list of available replication materials:

- [R code](https://github.com/norakirkizh/ml_politics/blob/master/category_stat.R) for exploring domain categories from Webshrinker: a [table](https://github.com/norakirkizh/ml_politics/blob/master/Sum_of_visits.csv) with descriptive statistics like sum of visits by group of domain categories;
- R code with regressions based on domain categories;
- R code with visualizations of regression outputs.
